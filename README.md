## Overview

Xsolla Payments SDK is used to integrate Xsolla Pay Station into Unreal Engine games. Xsolla Pay Station allows partners to monetize their product by providing users with a convenient UI to pay for in-game purchases in the game store.

The following integration options are available:

*   Integration with **your server side**  is suitable for partners who want to use Xsolla Pay Station with their own authentication method, in-game store, and playerâ€™s inventory.
*   Integration with **third-party service servers** is suitable for partners who already use third-party solutions to implement the server side, but want to use Xsolla Pay Station.

    **Info:** Currently, Xsolla provides integration with PlayFab services.

*   Serverless or **simplified integration** is suitable for partners who want to use Xsolla Pay Station for in-game purchases, but their games have no server part and game logic is implemented on the client side.

See the [wikis](https://github.com/xsolla/payments-ue4-sdk/wiki) to learn how to integrate Xsolla products using Payments UE4 SDK.
